# Pqthreads

Pqthreads exposes class interfaces from the main GUI Thread in another
QThread in [Qt for Python (PySide)](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python). In doing so, it facilitates communication between the
main (GUI) thread and a dedicated `QThread`s as offered by [Qt for Python](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python).

## Installation

Pqthreads comes as a [package](https://pypi.org/project/pqthreads/) in the
[Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed using pip:

```console
pip install pqthreads
```

## Usage

In order to use pqhreads, you'll first need a GUI implementation (in [Qt for
Python (PySide)](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)) whose interface you'd like
to expose. Then you need to have a corresponding class that exposes (chosen)
methods and attributes in another thread.

### GUI implementation

The GUI implementation would be a class that derives from
[QWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/PySide2/QtWidgets/QWidget.html), e.g.
[QMainWindow](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/PySide2/QtWidgets/QMainWindow.html).
A very basic example class called `FigureWindow` can be found in
[window.py](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/examples/window.py#L11).

### Worker class

In a class that inherits from
[containers.WorkerItem](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/containers.py#L90)
you then choose which methods and attributes are exposed. An examples of this is
the class `FigureWorker` as found in
[worker.py](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/examples/worker.py#L14).

### Putting it all together

Using the GUI implementation `FigureWindow` and worker class `FigureWorker` the
utilities from
[decorator.py](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/decorator.py)
can be used to create a custom decorator:

```python
from pqthreads import decorator

DecoratorCore = decorator.DecoratorCore
DecoratorCore.add_agent('figure', window.FigureWindow, FigureWorker)
decorator_example = decorator.Decorator(DecoratorCore)
``` 

Any decorated function will run in the worker thread, while all GUI elements run
in the (main) GUI thread.

To simplify access to worker class interfaces, a helper function is useful. This
also illustrates how to create and access new GUI elements:

```python
from pqthreads import refs

def figure(*args, **kwargs):
    """ Create, raise or modify FigureWorker objects """
    container = refs.worker.get('figure')
    if not args:
        return container.create(**kwargs)
    figure_worker = args[0]
    container.current = figure_worker
    return figure_worker
```

This can finally be used to to expose GUI implementation in an existing python
program that will run in another worker thread.

```python
from pqthreads.examples import worker

@decorator_example
def main():
    fig = worker.figure(title='Initial title')
    fig.change_title(title='Another title')
    fig.close()
```

## Pittfalls

As illustrated in the previous section, worker class interfaces are accessed
through the so-called `worker` references (as is provided in the module
[`refs`](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/refs.py)).
All interfaces are provided as weak references. As soon as the decorated
function is exited, the weak references will invalidate and can't be used
anymore. Therefore, it's recommended to decorate the function that encapsulates
the whole python program in question. This assures that different parts of your
own program run in different threads.

The module [`refs`](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/blob/master/pqthreads/refs.py) also comes with an object called `gui`
references that stores weak references to the GUI objects. These also will
invalidate when the decorated function is exited.

Finally, one should not access the `worker` references from the (main) GUI
thread and also not access `gui` references from the worker thread. This can
lead to trace errors and all sorts of undefined behavior. **You have been
warned!**

## Design

Pqthreads separates the GUI elements from all programming elements in
`QThread`s. Since Qt demands that the main thread is used for GUI elements, all
other programming functionalities are moved into a dedicated `QThread`. This
shall be called the worker threads.

The following schematic depicts this design.

![Pqthreads design](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/pqthreads/raw/master/doc/design.svg)

Communication between the GUI and worker threads is solely done using
Signal/Slot connections. This is facilitated by the `GUIAgent`s and
`WorkerAgent`s.

The interface of a GUI Object is exposed by means of a Worker Object in the
Worker Thread.

It is possible expose the interface of multiple types of GUI Objects (in the
shown schematic `FigureWindow` and `GraphWindow`), which requires multiple
`Worker`- and `GUIAgent`s. These are held the `GUIAgency` and `WorkerAgency`
respectively.

For each type of GUI/Worker object pair, it's also possible to instantiate
multiple objects (of the same type). GUI and Worker objects are held in the
`GUIItemContainer` and `WorkerItemContainer` respectively.
